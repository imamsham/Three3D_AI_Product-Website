showcasing the future of product customization with OpenAI Three.js 3D Product Website. Our team of web developers and designers have collaborated to bring you an exciting new experience combining AI with 3D space on websites.

Our aim is to create immersive experiences that inspire and delight users. We've used powerful tools such as React Three Fiber, Tailwindcss, Framer Motion, and Dall.E AI to create a product display page with a 3D T-shirt that animates to the center of the screen upon clicking the customize button.

Users can change the T-shirt's color, upload their own logo or texture, or even request AI to generate a customized logo or texture. Once satisfied with their design, users can toggle the logo and texture on or off and download the customized T-shirt.

Our project has been executed flawlessly by optimizing the model and implementing color variations, managing state, and creating smooth animations. We believe that this AI and 3D modeling product feature is a game-changer for textile websites.

We're passionate about sharing our expertise and experience in combining AI with 3D space on websites. Let's continue exploring the limitless possibilities of AI and 3D space together. Check out our website and join us in the journey to create immersive experiences that inspire and delight!
