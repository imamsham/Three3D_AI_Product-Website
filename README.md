#Future of Product Customization with OpenAI Three.js 3D Product Website
Exciting news! As a web developer, I've been exploring the limitless possibilities of combining AI with 3D space on websites. However, it's equally crucial to remember the game-changing metaverse vision presented by Meta a year ago. This vision changes the way we experience 3D spaces and paves the way for immersive experiences.

During my journey to bring product customization to the 3D space, I spent nearly three months refining my skills and studying numerous online sources. With this knowledge, I was able to transform my vision into a 3D model for the product page and build a sleek product display page using Three.js and React Three Fiber.

As a designer, I executed the project flawlessly by optimizing the model and implementing color variations, managing state, and creating smooth animations using Framer Motion.

I'm passionate about sharing my expertise and experience in combining AI with 3D space on websites. Together, let's create immersive experiences that inspire and delight! Check out our home page, where we showcase a 3D T-shirt that animates to the center of the screen upon clicking the customize button. Users can change the T-shirt's color, upload their own logo or texture, or even request AI to generate a customized logo or texture. Once satisfied with their design, users can toggle the logo and texture on or off and download the customized T-shirt. This AI and 3D modeling product feature is a game-changer for textile websites.

To build this website, we used powerful 3D graphics library, React Three Fiber, a library for Three.js in React, Tailwindcss for CSS styling framework, Framer Motion for animation in React, and Dall.E AL to generate and use images. Let's keep exploring the limitless possibilities of AI and 3D space!
